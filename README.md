Relaxo provides a set of tools and objects for interacting with CouchDB. It aims to be as simple and efficient as possible while still improving the usability of various CouchDB features.

Relaxo includes a command line script to import documents into a CouchDB database:

	relaxo http://localhost:5984/test design.yaml sample.yaml

Where `design.yaml` and `sample.yaml` contain lists of valid documents.
